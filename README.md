Hey, I'm Sid! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="35px">

I'm a Graduate student doing my Masters in Information Systems at the College of Engineering in Northeastern University, Boston.

I'm interested in Front-End Engineering and DevOps!

Prior to my studies at Northeastern, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer in the PAAS team for Ericsson, Hungary as an Embedded Software developer and as a Front-End developer for Uber at Wipro Ltd.

I was mainly involved in the development and maintenance of Ericsson's commercial router series codenamed NightHawk 8801. For a short period of time, I was a part of Uber's internal dashboard team,
where we built various dashboards for their teams.

I've also interned at Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), India where I developed oil and drilling data dashboards.
