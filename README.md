Hey, I'm Sid! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" height="25px" width="25px">

I'm a Graduate student doing my Masters in Information Systems at the College of Engineering in Northeastern University, Boston.

I'm interested in Fullstack Engineering, Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps!

Prior to my studies at Northeastern, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer in the PaaS team for Ericsson, Hungary as an Embedded Software developer and as a Front-End developer for Uber at Wipro Ltd.

I was mainly involved in the development and maintenance of Ericsson's commercial router series codenamed NightHawk 8801. For a short period of time, I was a part of Uber's internal dashboard team,
where we built various dashboards for their teams.

I've also interned at Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), India where I developed oil and drilling data dashboards.
